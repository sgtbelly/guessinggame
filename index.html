        <section>About me</section>
        <p>
                I grew up in Rocky Mount NC. After Highschool, I spent a year in college, decided it wasn't for me and joined the Army<br>
            While in the Army I went to many nice and intersting places Fort Polk, LA; Iraq; South Korea; Fort Lewis, WA; Afghanistan;<br> 
            Fort Leonard Wood, MO. After I got out of the Army I went to Lincoln, NE for a year until I found my current job.<br>
                I am married with one daughter; I met my wife while stationed in Korea; I always joke that I loved the culture<br>
            so much that I had to bring a peice back with me. Although it has been hard for us sometimes; she has stuck by my side<br>
            through multiple deployments to Afghanistan and is always our familys rock, and for that I will always love her.</p>
